# Skitter VM

Skitter VM is a virtual machine project that I'm actually
going to take seriously. I want the syntax to actually be
good, I want the performance to actually be good, I want
to map out the scope of the project and list the tasks I
want to accomplish, I want it to serve a purpose, and I want
it to be well documented. Eventually it'll reach a point
where I'll create the actual Skitter language that will
compile to this.

## TODO

I'm working on documenting the virtual machine and laying out
the roadmap to implementing everything. The bytecode file
defines the opcodes to be implemented. There's no decompiler
right now. There will be as the compiled code will become
complicated enough that I won't want to translate it. The
syntax file just gives an example of the goal of this virtual
machine.
