# Skitter VM

Skitter VM is a virtual machine project that I'm actually
going to take seriously. I want the syntax to actually be
good, I want the performance to actually be good, I want
to map out the scope of the project and list the tasks I
want to accomplish, I want it to serve a purpose, and I want
it to be well documented. Eventually it'll reach a point
where I'll create the actual Skitter language that will
compile to this.
